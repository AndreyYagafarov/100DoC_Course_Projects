# 100DoC_Course_Projects
An overarching repository containing the final course projects

This repository contrains the final course projects (day 80 to day 100) from the Angela Yu's Python course https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

The final projects in the course are given with minimal instructions, no tutoring ("trial by fire"), and no solutions provided.

As I am still doing the course, the relevant code will be uploaded when the projects are completed.

The repository covers the following projects:

Day 80 - data analysis (Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, sklearn Linear Regression) - final project following a number of lessons on data analysis and analytics (Pandas etc.)

Day 81 - (Python scripting) create a text-based Morse code translator. The project covers the basics of Python scripting (loops, dictionary comprehension, basic error handling).

Day 82 - 

Day 83 - (Python scripting) a text-based version of the tic-tac-toe game playable in the command line by two players. The final solution is implemented via simple functional (not object-oriented) script

Day 98 - (Data Science) Analyse and Visualise the Space Race. In addition to the data provided (which was up to 2020), I ran a web-parser (based on BeautifulSoup) on nextspaceflight.com to extract the most up-to-date (as of 18-Jul-2023). The project covers basics of data manipulation (data loading, exploration and cleaning, sorting, filtering, new columns (incl. using lambda functions), pivot tables), data analysis, and data visualisation
