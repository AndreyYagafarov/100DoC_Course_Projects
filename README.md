# 100DoC_Course_Projects
An overarching repository containing the final course projects
This repository contrains the final course projects (day 80 to day 100) from the Angela Yu's Python course https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

The final projects in the course are given with minimal instructions and no tutoring ("trial by fire").

As I am still doing the course, the relevant code will be uploaded when the projects are completed.

The repository covers the following projects:
Day 80 - data analysis (Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, sklearn Linear Regression) - final project following a number of lessons on data analysis and analytics (Pandas etc.)
